# 🧘‍♂️ The codingyogi's Zen Code Repository 🧘‍♀️

Welcome to my tranquil corner of the code universe! Here, we find balance not only in software but also in life through the art of yoga. 🌟

## About Me

🧘‍♂️ I'm a yogi by heart and a coder by choice. When I'm not on my mat, you can find me crafting elegant code and creating web magic.

🚀 As a software engineer, I'm on a quest to make the digital world a more peaceful and efficient place. My favorite asanas? HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Node.js, and more!

## What's Inside?

📦 This repository is a treasure trove of my coding adventures. From web development to backend wizardry, you'll find it all here.
